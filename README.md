# Casey-Campbell 
This is my GitHub Repo unveiling my completed processes and projects throughout my tenure as a student, as well as my own personal experience. 

I am committed to pushing Data Analytics, Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence, and Computer Science as a whole to the next level. With the being said, I will always retain knowledge and awareness of the capability and power of the system and process I am creating or working with. While doing so, I will hold all ethical and moral standard practices and values in the highest regard.
